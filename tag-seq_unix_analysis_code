#Preparation for Tagseq analysis. 

########## Get your data from basespace ##########

#1. You will receive an email from GSAF about your job with subject 'BaseSpace: Project Transfer Ownership Request'

#2. Login and click on accept and click on the job number.The next thing you will need will be the project ID number, which you can get from the web address of the project when you open in, for example: Project ID: hhttps://basespace.illumina.com/projects/397232062

#3. To download FASTQs from a project using BaseSpace CLI, you first want to make sure you are running at least version. If you are running an older version, please follow the steps and install or update it from the download page here: https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/cli/cli-overview

#4. To download the FASTQs, you would then use the command: bs download project -i=397232062 -o=~/ja23308 --extension=fastq.gz

#5. For example, here {ProjectID} is 146495357, and {destination} will be the local location where you want to save the files.

##Please note this is an example you will have to make sure you are using the right source and destinations

#6. You will need to move your raw data files from the work directory where basespace puts them to your scratch directory. To keep things neat. We recommend this kind of naming structure mv *.fastq //stor/work/WCAAR/rawdata/guerin_ja23308

########## Concatenate your files ##########
#Now you need to concatenate the fastq files. You will have  *_R1*.fastq.gz files with multiple lanes lanes (i.e. L001/L002/L003) per sample that needs to be collapsed into a single fastq.gz file for downstream analysis. You need to know ahead of time how many lanes your samples are spread across. You will want to cut your file names to have the same length after concatenation, removing the *L001 and *L002 part of the naming. The cut -c 22 is the number of characters you are going to cut, in this case 22 characters. The cut length may differ, depending on your naming, check your character length you want to cut before proceeding.

for a in $(find ./ -type f -name "*.fastq.gz" | while read F; do basename $F | rev | cut -c 22- | rev | uniq; done)
do echo "Merging R1" 
cat "$a"_L00*_R1_001.fastq.gz > "$a".fastq.gz
done;

#Move concatenated files to new directory to keep things organized. Then delete non-concatenated files. This way your won't confuse your concatenated and non-concatenated files. DO NOT DELETE IN YOUR RAW FASTQ FILE DIRECTORY. Check which directory you are in before proceeding (cd).

#Create new directory and move files
#make sure you are NOT in your raw fastq folder when you make your concat folder
mkdir concat_fastq
cp *.gz /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/
cd /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/

#Remove non-concatenated files 
rm *L00*.*

########## QC Step 1 ##########

#Create a FASTQC report for all fastq files before trimming and mapping. 
for a in *.fastq.gz; do fastqc $a; done


#Create new folder for the qc files 
mkdir QC_beforetrim
mv ./*qc*.* /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/QC_beforetrim
cd /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/QC_beforetrim

#To see a html version of each fastqc report use multiqc. This will create a mutilqc_.html. Download onto your local machine using scp and open it in a browser to view your QC metrics. 
multiqc .

cd ..

#Unzip files 
for a in *.gz; do gunzip $a; done

########## Trimming ########## 
#Trimming steps begin here. (1) Go to https://github.com/z0on/tag-based_RNAseq. Click on tagseq_trim_launch.pl and copy the code. Then paste the copied code into TextEdit on a Mac, Notepad++ on PC and save on your local computer as "tagseq_trim_launch.pl". The reason you need TextEdit is because it won't change characters like apoostrophes and will allow you to paste into nano. 

#To create this code on the POD, go to your folder that has your unzipped/concatenated fastq files. 
cd /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/
nano tagseq_trim_launch.pl

#Paste the copied code from your saved TextEdit file into the opened nano.
#save & exit nano 

Control+X then Y then enter

#Now do the same for the tagseq_clipper.pl code from the same Github page (https://github.com/z0on/tag-based_RNAseq). Copy the code, paste into a TextEdit (*.txt) file. Save on your local computer as "tagseq_clipper.pl". Go to your folder that has your unzipped/concatenated fastq files.

nano tagseq_clipper.pl

#Paste the copied code from your saved TextEdit file into the opened nano.
#save & exit nano 

Control+X then Y then enter

#Generate trimming commands for each fastq file, generating a "clean" file.
perl tagseq_trim_launch.pl  '\.fastq$' > clean

# Now you need to make sure that perl is at the beginning of each line clean code. 
sed -i 's|tagseq_clipper.pl|perl tagseq_clipper.pl|g' clean

#Make Trimming commands executable 
chmod +x clean 
nano clean #to check it 
#Execute Trimming command and make a trim.stats summary folder. This can take a while, keep typing ls to see progress 
nohup ./clean &>trim.stats &

#Move your trim files to a new directory to keep things clean 
mkdir trim_files
mv *.trim /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/trim_files
cd /stor/work/Fonken/UT21_tagseq/JA24159-423452132/concat_fastq/trim_files

#QC, take a look at these files to see what happened during trimming 
for a in *.trim; do fastqc $a; done

########## GERCC reference genome build ##########
##GERCC STAR are already in the references folder with STAR build. If you need to do this again yourself with an updated version the code is below. 
### Make sure you get the latest versions of the reference files. THESE VERSIONS ARE UPDATED AS OF MARCH 23, 2022 for GRCm39 build. 

### To include ERCC in mapping and counting file 
wget "https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_095047.txt"

### Make ERCC.fa file
cat cms_095047.txt | awk -F "\t" -v OFS="" 'NR>1{print ">",$1," ",$2," ",$3," ",$4,"\n",$5}' > ercc.fa

### Get the fasta files and GTF files from Gencode https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/
### Genome sequence (GRCm39)	ALL

wget https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M33/GRCm39.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz

gunzip GRCm39.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz

### Get the gtf file Comprehensive gene annotation	ALL
wget https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M33/gencode.vM33.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf.gz

gunzip gencode.vM33.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf.gz

### Make a copy of the file
cp GRCm39.genome.fa ERCC.GRCm39.genome.fa
cp  gencode.vM28.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf  ERCC.gencode.vM28.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf
cat ercc.fa >> ERCC.GRCm39.genome.fa

### Take a look
column -s, -t < cms_095047.txt | less -#2 -N -S

### Create ERCC gtf
cat cms_095047.txt | awk -F "\t" -v OFS="" 'NR>1{print $1,"\t","ercc","\t","gene","\t","1","\t",length($5),"\t",".","\t","+","\t",".","\t","gene_id \"G",$1,"\"; ","gene_version \"1\"; ", "gene_name \"",$1,"\"; ","gene_source \"ercc\"; ","gene_type \"ercc\";"}' > ercc.gtf

### Take a look at head
head ercc.gtf
 
### The ercc.gtf is appended to the bottom of the GTF/GFF file.
cat ercc.gtf >> ERCC.gencode.vM28.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf


########## STAR reference genome build ##########
## Make Star Genome - if already made you don't need to do this

########## STAR mapping your samples ##########
#You will need  to locate the pre-made STAR genome scaffold in the your references directory (/stor/work/Fonken/references/mRatBN7)
#Make a new folder called star_trim before running code for the trimmed STAR files

########## HTseq ########## (for counting reads)
##if you have an error about loading HTseq environment (Script 'scripts/htseq-count' not found in metadata at '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/HTSeq-0.6.1p1.egg-info'). Solution I used was to create a conda environment with python 2.7. Then conda install -c bioconda htseq, updated in miniconda3.

conda activate py2.7
for i in `ls -1 *.bam | sed 's/.bam//'`; do htseq-count -m intersection-nonempty -s yes -f bam -r pos -t gene $i.bam /stor/work/Fonken/references/mRatBN7/genes/genes.gtf > $i.count.sorted.txt ;done
